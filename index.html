                    I am a student of undergrade level. I have passed my school & college both from Ideal School &
                    College. Now I am a student of Military Institute of Science & Technology.I am doing my bachelor
                    degree on Computer Science & Engineering. I had a very good interest on html from my intermediate
                    life. So I wanted to be a web developer .This "Programming Hero" course is my first step towards the
                    dream. I am very thnkful to the course head Jhankar Sir.

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>To become a web developer is not an easy task. It needs a lot of hardwork & dedication. At least one
                    third of the should be invested to learn web development. But it's not so easy for a student to make
                    time for individual learning time beside the academic study.</p>

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>To achieve the ultemate goal I have to sacrifice my social life as much as possible. I have to
                    understand that ,if karina kapoor got marrid or messi win a new ballon d'or or Bangladesh gain new
                    milestone for covid deseaster that won't matter. Those are not my business.</p>

            <div id="block-three">
                <img class="icon" src="images/illustrators/illustrator-3.png" alt="">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Now I am a learner. My target is to achieve something from the course. I want to see myself on a good
                    position after a year or two. I want to make my parents proud. My ultemate goal is to be a leader
                    from a learner.</p>

                <p>There is a saying "To learn is fun". If someone find interest in anything rether thinking it as a
                    pressure or burden it becomes more enjoyable to do. From the very beginning html was an unknown
                    language
                    to me but now it's comfortable to use and implement. I want to do many projects regarding web
                    developement.So I have started doing it with self interest. Here is the github link where I started
                    learning.</p>
